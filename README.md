# CHEERS_Challenge
We are participating the the CHEERS NLP challenge and this is our code :).
## Short Challenge Desription
The aim of the CHEERS challenge is to exploit the latest advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assist responders and analysts in humanitarian crises for analyzing and harvesting valuable information from data. The challenge is hosted by Data Friendly Space (DFS), a non-profit organization, and is also supported by the academic researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. We encourages anyone who is interested in advancing the applications of NLP and Deep/Machine Learning in the humanitarian sector to take part in this challenge, as the benefits would be immediately seen in helping to increase the quality of the humanitarian communityâ€™s data analysis. As such, humanitarian analysts would be able to spend time doing what the human mind does best: subjective analysis of information.
